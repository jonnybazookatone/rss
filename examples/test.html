very massive black hole provides a unique opportunity to investigate the origin
of very high energy (VHE; E&gt;100 GeV) gamma-ray emission generated in
relativistic outflows and the surroundings of super-massive black holes. M 87
has been established as a VHE gamma-ray emitter since 2006. The VHE gamma-ray
emission displays strong variability on timescales as short as a day. In this
paper, results from a joint VHE monitoring campaign on M 87 by the MAGIC and
VERITAS instruments in 2010 are reported. During the campaign, a flare at VHE
was detected triggering further observations at VHE (H.E.S.S.), X-rays
(Chandra), and radio (43 GHz VLBA). The excellent sampling of the VHE gamma-ray
light curve enables one to derive a precise temporal characterization of the
flare: the single, isolated flare is well described by a two-sided exponential
function with significantly different flux rise and decay times. While the
overall variability pattern of the 2010 flare appears somewhat different from
that of previous VHE flares in 2005 and 2008, they share very similar
timescales (~day), peak fluxes (Phi(&gt;0.35 TeV) ~= (1-3) x 10^-11 ph cm^-2
s^-1), and VHE spectra. 43 GHz VLBA radio observations of the inner jet regions
indicate no enhanced flux in 2010 in contrast to observations in 2008, where an
increase of the radio flux of the innermost core regions coincided with a VHE
flare. On the other hand, Chandra X-ray observations taken ~3 days after the
peak of the VHE gamma-ray emission reveal an enhanced flux from the core. The
long-term (2001-2010) multi-wavelength light curve of M 87, spanning from radio
to VHE and including data from HST, LT, VLA and EVN, is used to further
investigate the origin of the VHE gamma-ray emission. No unique, common MWL
signature of the three VHE flares has been identified.

</p>	<p><h3><b>The 2010 M 87 VHE flare and its origin: the multi-wavelength picture. (arXiv:1111.5344v1 [astro-ph.CO])</b></h3></p>	<p><p>The giant radio galaxy M 87, with its proximity (16 Mpc) and its very massive
black hole ((3 - 6) \times 10^9 M_solar), provides a unique laboratory to
investigate very high energy (E&gt;100 GeV; VHE) gamma-ray emission from active
galactic nuclei and, thereby, probe particle acceleration to relativistic
energies near supermassive black holes (SMBH) and in relativistic jets. M 87
has been established as a VHE gamma-ray emitter since 2005. The VHE gamma-ray
emission displays strong variability on timescales as short as a day. In 2008,
a rise in the 43 GHz Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) radio emission of the
innermost region (core; extension of &lt; 100 Rs ; Schwarzschild radii) was found
to coincide with a flaring activity at VHE. This had been interpreted as a
strong indication that the VHE emission is produced in the direct vicinity of
the SMBH. In 2010 a flare at VHE was again detected triggering further
multi-wavelength (MWL) observations with the VLBA, Chandra, and other
instruments. At the same time, M 87 was also observed with the Fermi-LAT
telescope at MeV/GeV energies, the European VLBI Network (EVN), and the
Liverpool Telescope (LT). Here, preliminary results from the 2010 campaign will
be reported.

</p>	<p><h3><b>Spectral and spatial observations of microwave spikes and zebra structure in the short radio burst of May 29, 2003. (arXiv:1111.5405v1 [astro-ph.SR])</b></h3></p>	<p><p>The unusual radio burst of May 29, 2003 connected with the M1.5 flare in AR
10368 has been analyzed. It was observed by the Solar Broadband Radio
Spectrometer (SBRS/Huairou station, Beijing) in the 5.2-7.6 GHz range. It
proved to be only the third case of a neat zebra structure appearing among all
observations at such high frequencies. Despite the short duration of the burst
(25 s), it provided a wealth of data for studying the superfine structure with
millisecond resolution (5 ms). We localize the site of emission sources in the
flare region, estimate plasma parameters in the generation sites, and suggest
applicable mechanisms for interpretating spikes and zebra-structure generation.
Positions of radio bursts were obtained by the Siberian Solar Radio Telescope
(SSRT) (5.7 GHz) and Nobeyama radioheliograph (NoRH) (17 GHz). The sources in
intensity gravitated to tops of short loops at 17 GHz, and to long loops at 5.7
GHz. Short pulses at 17 GHz (with a temporal resolution of 100 ms) are
registered in the R-polarized source over the N-magnetic polarity
(extraordinary mode). Dynamic spectra show that all the emission comprised
millisecond pulses (spikes) of 5-10 ms duration in the instantaneous band of 70
to 100 MHz, forming the superfine structure of different bursts, essentially in
the form of fast or slow-drift fibers and various zebra-structure stripes. Five
scales of zebra structures have been singled out. As the main mechanism for
generating spikes (as the initial emission) we suggest the coalescence of
plasma waves with whistlers in the pulse regime of interaction between
whistlers and ion-sound waves. In this case one can explain the appearance of
fibers and sporadic zebra-structure stripes exhibiting the frequency splitting.

</p>	<p><h3><b>Star-forming galaxies with hot dust emission in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey discovered by the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE). (arXiv:1111.5450v1 [astro-ph.CO])</b></h3></p>	<p><p>We present the results of a search for Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS)
emission-line galaxies with very red 3.4mum - 4.6mum (W1-W2) colours in the
Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) Preliminary Release Source Catalogue
(PRSC) aiming to find objects with hot dust emission. For this purpose we
considered a sample of ~16000 galaxies with strong emission lines selected out
of a total of ~900000 SDSS spectra and identified them with the PRSC sources.
We find that ~5000 sources out of the ~16000 SDSS galaxies are present in the
PRSC, including ~1000 galaxies with sufficiently strong [OIII]4363 emission
lines to permit reliable determinations of the oxygen abundance. No correlation
of W1-W2 with metallicity is found. On the other hand, there is clear evidence
for a redder W1-W2 index in galaxies with higher Hbeta luminosity and higher
Hbeta equivalent width, implying that strong UV radiation from young starbursts
efficiently heats interstellar dust to high temperatures. However, galaxies
with very red colours W1-W2&gt;2 mag, similar to that in the local extreme
star-forming galaxy SBS 0335-052E, are very rare. In addition to three
previously known sources, which are not present in our sample, we found only
four such galaxies.

</p>	<p><h3><b>UHE neutrinos from Pop III stars: concept and constraints. (arXiv:1111.5461v1 [astro-ph.HE])</b></h3></p>	<p><p>We reconsider the model of neutrino production during the 'bright phase',
first suggested in 1977, in the light of modern understanding of the role of
Pop III stars and acceleration of particles in supernova shocks. We concentrate
on the production of cosmogenic UHE neutrinos in supernova explosions that
accompany the death of Pop III stars. Accelerated protons produce neutrinos in
collisions with CMB photons. We deliberately use simplified assumptions which
make our results transparent. Pop III stars are assumed to be responsible for
the reionization of the universe as observed by WMAP. Since the evolution of
Pop III stars is much faster than the Hubble rate, we consider the burst of UHE
proton production to occur at fixed redshift (z_b=10-20). We discuss the
formation of collisionless shocks and particle acceleration in the early
universe. The composition of accelerated particles is expected to be proton
dominated. A simple calculation is presented to illustrate the fact that the
diffuse neutrinos flux from the bright phase burst is concentrated in a
relatively narrow range around $7.5 \times 10^{15}(20/z_b)^2$ eV. The $\nu_\mu$
flux may be detectable by IceCube without violating the cascade upper limit and
the expected energetics of SNe associated with Pop III stars. A possible
signature of the neutrino production from Pop III stars may be the detection of
resonant neutrino events. For the burst at $z_b=20$ and $\bar{\nu}_e$-flux at
the cascade upper limit, the number of resonant events in IceCube may be as
high as 10 events in 5 years of observations. These events have equal energies,
$E=6.3\times 10^{15}$ eV, in the form of e-m cascades. Given the large
uncertainties in the existing predictions of UHE cosmogenic neutrino fluxes, we
argue that neutrinos from the first stars might become one of the most reliable
hopes for UHE neutrino astronomy.

</p>	<p><h3><b>Investigation of the Progenitors of Nova Explosions. (arXiv:1111.5524v1 [astro-ph.SR])</b></h3></p>	<p><p>Recurrent novae (RNe) play an important role as one of the suspected
progenitor systems of Type Ia supernovae (SNe) which are used as primary
distance indicators in cosmology. Thus, it is important to investigate the
nature of their central binary systems to determine the relation between the
parameters of the central system and outburst type, and finally ascertain the
population of novae that might be available to give rise to the progenitors of
Type Ia SNe. The details of the preliminary investigation looking for
characteristics that may distinguish recurrent and classical novae (CNe)
systems, the selection of initial targets for detailed study, and preliminary
results are presented. We identify 10 suspected RNe among the Galactic CNe
population and our initial photometric observations of their quiescent systems
suggest 2 may belong to the RS Oph type and 2 to the U Sco type RNe.
Spectroscopic follow-up is now underway.

</p>	<p><h3><b>Dwarf Nova V1040 Centauri and Variable Stars in its Vicinity. (arXiv:1111.5542v1 [astro-ph.SR])</b></h3></p>	<p><p>We present the results of a photometric campaign of the dwarf nova V1040 Cen.
The light curve shows two normal outbursts with recurrence time ~ 40 days and
amplitude ~ 2.5 mag. Quiescence data show oscillations with periods in the
range ~ 0.1 days (2.4 h) to ~ 0.5 days (12 h) of unknown origin. We measured
the orbital period of V1040 Cen to be P_orb=0.060458(80) days (1.451+-0.002 h).
Based on the M_v-P_orb relation we found the distance of V1040 Cen to be 88+-31
pc. In this paper we also report the detection of eleven new variable stars in
the field of the monitored dwarf nova.

</p>	<p><h3><b>Constraining Cosmic Rays and Magnetic Fields in the Perseus Galaxy Cluster with TeV observations by the MAGIC telescopes. (arXiv:1111.5544v1 [astro-ph.HE])</b></h3></p>	<p><p>Galaxy clusters are being assembled today in the most energetic phase of
hierarchical structure formation which manifests itself in powerful shocks that
contribute to a substantial energy density of cosmic rays (CRs). Hence,
clusters are expected to be luminous gamma-ray emitters since they also act as
energy reservoirs for additional CR sources, such as active galactic nuclei and
supernova-driven galactic winds. To detect the gamma-ray emission from CR
interactions with the ambient cluster gas, we conducted the deepest to date
observational campaign targeting a galaxy cluster at very high-energy
gamma-rays and observed the Perseus cluster with the MAGIC Cherenkov telescopes
for a total of ~85 hr of effective observing time. This campaign resulted in
the detection of the central radio galaxy NGC 1275 at energies E &gt; 100 GeV with
a very steep energy spectrum. Here, we restrict our analysis to energies E &gt;
630 GeV and detect no significant gamma-ray excess. This constrains the average
CR-to-thermal pressure ratio to be &lt;= 1-2%, depending on assumptions and the
model for CR emission. Comparing these gamma-ray upper limits to predictions
from cosmological cluster simulations that include CRs constrains the maximum
CR acceleration efficiency at structure formation shocks to be &lt; 50%.
Alternatively, this may argue for non-negligible CR transport processes such as
CR streaming and diffusion into the outer cluster regions. Finally, we derive
lower limits on the magnetic field distribution assuming that the Perseus radio
mini-halo is generated by secondary electrons/positrons that are created in
hadronic CR interactions: assuming a spectrum of E^-2.2 around TeV energies as
implied by cluster simulations, we limit the central magnetic field to be &gt; 4-9
microG, depending on the rate of decline of the magnetic field strength toward
larger radii.
