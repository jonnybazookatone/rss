provide important information about the activity of their central engines and
their environments. In particular, the short timescale variability, such as
bumps and/or rebrightening features visible in the multi-wavelength light
curves, is still poorly understood.
</p>
<p>Aims. We analyze the multi-wavelength observations of the GRB100219A
afterglow at redshift 4.7. In particular, we attempt to identify the physical
origin of the late achromatic flares/bumps detected in the X-ray and optical
bands.
</p>
<p>Methods. We present ground-based optical photometric data and Swift X-ray
observations on GRB100219A. We analyzed the temporal behavior of the X-ray and
optical light curves, as well as the X-ray spectra.
</p>
<p>Results. The early flares in the X-ray and optical light curves peak
simultaneously at about 1000 s after the burst trigger, while late achromatic
bumps in the X-ray and optical bands appear at about 20000 s after the burst
trigger. These are uncommon features in the afterglow phenomenology.
Considering the temporal and spectral properties, we argue that both optical
and X-ray emissions come from the same mechanism. The late flares/bumps may be
produced by late internal shocks from long-lasting activity of the central
engine. An off-axis origin for a structured jet model is also discussed to
interpret the bump shapes. The early optical bump can be interpreted as the
afterglow onset, while the early X-ray flare could be caused by the internal
activity. GRB 100219A exploded in a dense environment as revealed by the strong
attenuation of X-ray emission and the optical-to-X-ray spectral energy
distribution.

</p>	<p><h3><b>A generalized likelihood ratio test statistic for Cherenkov telescope data. (arXiv:1112.0786v1 [astro-ph.IM])</b></h3></p>	<p><p>Astrophysical sources of TeV gamma rays are usually established by Cherenkov
telescope observations. These counting type instruments have a field of view of
few degrees in diameter and record large numbers of particle air showers via
their Cherenkov radiation in the atmosphere. The showers are either induced by
gamma rays or diffuse cosmic ray background. The commonly used test statistic
to evaluate a possible gamma-ray excess is Li and Ma (1983), Eq. 17, which can
be applied to independent on- and off-source observations, or scenarios that
can be approximated as such. This formula however is unsuitable if the data are
taken in so-called "wobble" mode (pointing to several offset positions around
the source), if at the same time the acceptance shape is irregular or even
depends on the pointing direction. To provide a robust test statistic in such
cases, this paper explores a possible generalization of the likelihood ratio
concept on which the formula of Li and Ma is based. In doing so, we fully
exploit the multi-pointing nature of the data and the typically known
instrument point spread function to derive a new, seminumerical test statistic.
Due to its flexibility and robustness against systematic uncertainties, it is
not only useful for detection purposes, but also for skymapping and source
shape fitting. We present simplified Monte Carlo simulations to verify the
results, and discuss several applications and further generalizations of the
concept.

</p>	<p><h3><b>The theory of stellar winds. (arXiv:1112.0952v1 [astro-ph.SR])</b></h3></p>	<p><p>We present a brief overview of the theory of stellar winds with a strong
emphasis on the radiation-driven outflows from massive stars. The resulting
implications for the evolution and fate of massive stars are also discussed.
Furthermore, we relate the effects of mass loss to the angular momentum
evolution, which is particularly relevant for the production of long and soft
gamma-ray bursts. Mass-loss rates are not only a function of the metallicity,
but are also found to depend on temperature, particularly in the region of the
bi-stability jump at 21 000 Kelvin. We highlight the role of the bi-stability
jump for Luminous Blue Variable (LBV) stars, and discuss suggestions that LBVs
might be direct progenitors of supernovae. We emphasize that radiation-driven
wind studies rely heavily on the input opacity data and linelists, and that
these are thus of fundamental importance to both the mass-loss predictions
themselves, as well as to our overall understanding of the lives and deaths of
massive stars.

debate. EGRB can either have truly diffuse or unresolved discrete point sources
origin. Majority of the Fermi and EGRET detected identified sources are blazar.
So, they are expected to be a significant contributors to the EGRB. In order to
estimate their contribution to the EGRB one needs to construct their luminosity
functions. Here, we examine and construct the evolution and luminosity function
of blazars using first LAT AGN catalog. We consider both pure luminosity and
pure density evolution models for flat spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs). We also
describe the methodology to estimate the contribution from misaligned blazars
to the EGRB.

</p>	<p><h3><b>The X-ray light curve of Gamma-ray bursts: clues on the central engine. (arXiv:1112.1058v1 [astro-ph.HE])</b></h3></p>	<p><p>We present the analysis of a large sample of Gamma-ray burst (GRB) X-ray
light curves in the rest frame to characterise their intrinsic properties in
the context of different theoretical scenarios. We determine the morphology,
time-scales and energetics of 64 long GRBs observed by Swift/XRT without
flaring activity. We furthermore provide a one-to-one comparison to the
properties of GRBs with X-ray flares. We find that the steep decay morphology
and its connection with X-ray flares favor a scenario in which a central engine
origin, as proposed by Kumar et al. (2008). We show that this scenario can
account also for the shallow decay phase, provided that the GRB progenitor star
has a self-similar structure with a constant envelope to core mass ratio $\sim
0.02-0.03$. However, difficulties arise for very long duration
($t_p\gtrsim10^4$ s) shallow phases. Alternatively, a spinning-down magnetar
whose emitted power refreshes the forward shock can quantitatively account for
the shallow decay properties. In particular we demonstrate that this model can
account for the plateau luminosity vs. end time anticorrelation found by
Dainotti et al. (2008, 2010).

general similarities to the gamma-ray emitting blazars (evidences of
relativistic jets, non-thermal radio to X-ray emission). In fact, the first
source of this type, Cyg X-3, has been recently unambiguously discovered by the
satellite telescopes. We study the features of the gamma-ray radiation produced
in these sources by relativistic electrons, accelerated in the inner part of
the jet. The electrons initiate an Inverse Compton e^\pm pair cascade in the
radiation field of the accretion disk. Due to the anisotropy of the accretion
disk radiation field, the spectra of gamma-rays show strong dependence on the
observation angle, the location of the emission region within the jet and the
details of the acceleration process. As an example, we confront our model with
the observations of the microquasar Cyg X-3, which has been recently reported
as a transient GeV gamma-ray source by the Agile and the Fermi Observatories.
Satisfactory description of the gamma-ray spectra observed from Cyg X-3 are
obtained in the case of the injection of electrons in the inner part of the jet
(located within 300 inner disk radius from the jet base) provided that the
observer is located at relatively small angle to the jet axis.

</p>	<p><h3><b>In pursuit of gamma-ray burst progenitors: the identification of a sub-population of rotating Wolf-Rayet stars. (arXiv:1111.5806v2 [astro-ph.SR] UPDATED)</b></h3></p>	<p><p>Long gamma-ray bursts involve the most powerful cosmic explosions since the
Big Bang. Whilst it has been established that GRBs are related to the death
throes of massive stars, the identification of their progenitors has proved
challenging. Theory suggests that rotating Wolf-Rayet stars are the best
candidates, but their strong stellar winds shroud their surfaces, preventing a
direct measurement of their rotation. Fortunately, linear spectropolarimetry
may be used to probe the flattening of their winds due to stellar spin.
Spectropolarimetry surveys show that an 80% majority of WR stars have
spherically symmetric winds and are thus rotating slowly, yet a small 20%
minority display a spectropolarimetric signature indicative of rotation. Here
we find a highly significant correlation between WR objects that carry the
signature of stellar rotation and the subset of WR stars with ejecta nebulae
that have only recently transitioned from a red sugergiant or luminous blue
variable phase. As these youthful WR stars have yet to spin-down due to mass
loss, they are the best candidate GRB progenitors identified to date. When we
take recently published WR ejecta nebula numbers we find that five out of the
six line-effect WR stars are surrounded by ejecta nebulae. The statistics imply
that the null hypothesis of no correlation between line-effect WR stars and
ejecta nebulae can be rejected at the 0.0004% level. Given that four
line-effect and WR ejecta nebula have spectroscopically been confirmed to
contain nucleosynthetic products, we argue that the correlation is both
statistically significant and physically convincing. The implication is that we
have identified a WR sub-population that fulfills the necessary criteria for
making GRBs. Finally, we discuss the potential of identifying GRB progenitors
via spectropolarimetry with extremely large telescopes.

towards understanding blazars, the most extreme class of Active Galactic
Nuclei. A large fraction of the population detected by Fermi is formed by BL
Lacertae (BL Lac) objects, whose sample has always suffered from a severe
redshift incompleteness due to the quasi-featureless optical spectra. Our goal
is to provide a significant increase of the number of confirmed high-redshift
BL Lac objects contained in the 2 LAC Fermi/LAT catalog. For 103 Fermi/LAT
blazars, photometric redshifts using spectral energy distribution fitting have
been obtained. The photometry includes 13 broad-band filters from the far
ultraviolet to the near-IR observed with Swift/UVOT and the multi-channel
imager GROND at the MPG/ESO 2.2m telescope. Data have been taken
quasi-simultaneously and the remaining source-intrinsic variability has been
corrected for. We release the UV-to-near-IR 13-band photometry for all 103
sources and provide redshift constraints for 75 sources without previously
known redshift. Out of those, eight have reliable photometric redshifts at
z&gt;1.3, while for the other 67 sources we provide upper limits. Six of the
former eight are BL Lac objects, which quadruples the sample of confirmed
high-redshift BL Lac. This includes three sources with redshifts higher than
the previous record for BL Lac, including CRATES J0402-2615 with the best-fit
solution at z~1.9.

</p>	<p><h3><b>Predicted power in ultra high energy cosmic rays from active galaxies. (arXiv:1106.5109v2 [astro-ph.HE] CROSS LISTED)</b></h3></p>	<p><p>Context: As more and more data are collected by cosmic ray experiments such
as the Pierre Auger Observatory and Telescope Array (TA), the search for the
sources of the Ultra High Energy Cosmic Rays (UHECR) continues. Already we have
some hints about the sources or type of sources involved and more work is
required to confirm any of this. Aims: We intend to predict the UHECR fluxes
and the maximal energies of particles from two complete samples of nearby
active galaxies, selected at radio and far-infrared frequencies. Also, we
investigate the magnetic scattering of the UHECR path in the intervening cosmic
space. Methods: We propose here a new method of searching for the sources of
the UHECR in three steps, first we model the activity of the type of sources
and get the flux of UHECR and a maximal energy for particle acceleration, then
we model the interaction and angle deflection in the intergalactic space and
finally we simulate the distribution of the cosmic rays events that can be
statistically compared with future data of the cosmic rays observatories.
Results: We analyzed two classes of sources, gamma ray bursts (GRBs) and Radio
Galaxies (RGs). Ordering by the UHECR flux, few RGs are viable candidates, as
for GRB many sources are viable candidates, requiring less scattering of the
particles along their path to Earth to interpret the presently observed sky
distribution. Most of the flux from RGs comes from the Southern sky, and most
of the flux of particles from GRB comes from the North, although the
differences are so small as to require large statistics to confirm this. The
intergalactic and Galactic magnetic fields may help to distinguish the two
extreme cases, also pure protons from heavy nuclei at the same energy. As a
consequence flat spectrum radio sources such as 3C279 should confirm the
production of UHECR in this class of sources through energetic neutrinos.
