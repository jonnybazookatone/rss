V<p>We present the detection of pulsed gamma-ray emission from the Crab Pulsar\u000aabove 100 GeV with the VERITAS array of atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes.\u000aGamma-ray emission at theses energies is not expected in present pulsar models.\u000aWe find that the photon spectrum of pulsed emission between 100 MeV and 400 GeV\u000acan be described by a broken power law, and that it is statistically preferred\u000aover a power law with an exponential cut-off. In the VERITAS energy range the\u000aspectrum can be described with a simple power law with a spectral index of -3.8\u000aand a flux normalization at 150 GeV that is equivalent to 1 % of the Crab\u000aNebula gamma-ray flux. The detection of pulsed emission above 100 GeV and the\u000aabsence of an exponential cutoff rules out curvature radiation as the primary\u000agamma-ray-producing mechanism.

V<p>We report on the development of Mezcal-SRHD, a new adaptive mesh refinement,\u000aspecial relativistic hydrodynamics (SRHD) code, developed with the aim of\u000astudying the highly relativistic flows in Gamma-Ray Burst sources. The SRHD\u000aequations are solved using finite volume conservative solvers. The correct\u000aimplementation of the algorithms is verified by one-dimensional (1D) shock tube\u000aand multidimensional tests. The code is then applied to study the propagation\u000aof 1D spherical impulsive blast waves expanding in a stratified medium with\u000a$\u005crho \u005cpropto r^{-k}$, bridging between the relativistic and Newtonian phases,\u000aas well as to a two-dimensional (2D) cylindrically symmetric impulsive jet\u000apropagating in a constant density medium. It is shown that the deceleration to\u000anon-relativistic speeds in one-dimension occurs on scales significantly larger\u000athan the Sedov length. This transition is further delayed with respect to the\u000aSedov length as the degree of stratification of the ambient medium is\u000aincreased.

V<p>Gamma ray bursts (GRBs) have great advantages for their huge burst energies,\u000aluminosities and high redshifts in probing the Universe. A few interesting\u000aluminosity correlations of GRBs have been used to test cosmology models.\u000aEspecially, for a subsample of long GRBs with known redshifts and a plateau\u000aphase in the afterglow, a correlation between the end time of the plateau phase\u000a(in the GRB rest frame) and the corresponding X-ray luminosity has been found.\u000aIn this paper, we re-analyze the subsample and found that a significantly\u000atighter correlation exists when we add a third parameter, i.e. the isotropic\u000a$\u005cgamma$-ray energy release, into the consideration. Additionally, both long\u000aand intermediate duration GRBs are consistent with the same three-parameter\u000acorrelation equation. It is argued that the new three-parameter correlation is\u000aconsistent with the hypothesis that the subsample of GRBs with a plateau phase\u000ain the afterglow be associated with the birth of rapidly rotating magnetars,\u000aand that the plateau be due to the continuous energy-injection from the\u000amagnetar. It is suggested that the newly born millisecond magnetars associated\u000awith GRBs might provide a good standard candle in the Universe.\u000a</p>
