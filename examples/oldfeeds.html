underlying the observed phenomenology is magnetized to some extent. Within this
context, radiative signatures of dissipation of kinetic and magnetic energy in
internal shocks of relativistic magnetized outflows are studied. We model
internal shocks as being caused by collisions of homogeneous plasma shells with
non-zero relative velocity. We compute the flow state after the shell
interaction by solving Riemann problems at the contact surface between the
colliding shells, and then compute the emission from the resulting shocks.
Under the assumption of a constant flow luminosity we find that there is a
clear difference between the models where both shells are weakly magnetized
({\sigma} &lt;~ 0.01) and those where, at least, one shell has a {\sigma} &gt;~ 0.01.
We obtain that the radiative efficiency is largest for models in which,
regardless of the ordering, one shell is weakly and the other strongly
magnetized. Substantial differences between weakly and strongly magnetized
shell collisions are observed in the inverse-Compton part of the spectrum, as
well as in the optical, X-ray and 1GeV light curves. We propose a way to
distinguish observationally between weakly magnetized from magnetized internal
shocks by comparing the maximum frequency of the inverse-Compton and
synchrotron part of the spectrum to the ratio of the inverse-Compton and
synchrotron fluence. Finally, our results suggest that LBL blazars may
correspond to barely magnetized flows, while HBL blazars could correspond to
moderately magnetized ones. Indeed, by comparing with actual blazar
observations we conclude that the magnetization of typical blazars is {\sigma}
&lt;~ 0.01.

</p>	<p><h3><b>Characterization of a tagged $\gamma$-ray beam line at the DA$\Phi$NE Beam Test Facility. (arXiv:1111.6147v1 [physics.ins-det])</b></h3></p>	<p><p>At the core of the AGILE scientific instrument, designed to operate on a
satellite, there is the Gamma Ray Imaging Detector (GRID) consisting of a
Silicon Tracker (ST), a Cesium Iodide Mini-Calorimeter and an Anti-Coincidence
system of plastic scintillator bars. The ST needs an on-ground calibration with
a $\gamma$-ray beam to validate the simulation used to calculate the energy
response function and the effective area versus the energy and the direction of
the $\gamma$ rays. A tagged $\gamma$-ray beam line was designed at the Beam
Test Facility (BTF) of the INFN Laboratori Nazionali of Frascati (LNF), based
on an electron beam generating $\gamma$ rays through Bremsstrahlung in a
position-sensitive target. The $\gamma$-ray energy is deduced by difference
with the post-Bremsstrahlung electron energy \cite{prest}-\cite{hasan}. The
electron energy is measured by a spectrometer consisting of a dipole magnet and
an array of position sensitive silicon strip detectors, the Photon Tagging
System (PTS). The use of the combined BTF-PTS system as tagged photon beam
requires understanding the efficiency of $\gamma$-ray tagging, the probability
of fake tagging, the energy resolution and the relation of the PTS hit position
versus the $\gamma$-ray energy. This paper describes this study comparing data
taken during the AGILE calibration occurred in 2005 with simulation.

</p>	<p><h3><b>Toward tight gamma-ray burst luminosity relations. (arXiv:1111.6249v1 [astro-ph.CO])</b></h3></p>	<p><p>The large scatters of luminosity relations of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) have
been one of the most important reasons that prevent the extensive applications
of GRBs in cosmology. Many efforts have been made to seek tight luminosity
relations. With the latest sample of 116 GRBs, we investigated 6
two-dimensional (2D) correlations and 14 derived three-dimensional (3D)
correlations of GRBs to explore the possibility of decreasing the intrinsic
scatters of the luminosity relations of GRBs. We found the 3D correlation of
$E_{\mathrm{peak}}$--$\tau_{\mathrm{RT}}$--$L$ to be significantly tighter (at
$2 \sigma$ confidence level) than its corresponding 2D correlations, i.e., the
$E_{\mathrm{peak}}$--$L$ and $\tau_{\mathrm{RT}}$--$L$ correlation. In
addition, the coefficients before the logarithms of $E_{\mathrm{peak}}$ and
$\tau_{\mathrm{RT}}$ in the $E_{\mathrm{peak}}$--$\tau_{\mathrm{RT}}$--$L$
correlation are almost exactly opposite to each other. Inputting this situation
as a prior reduces the relation to $L \propto (E_{\mathrm{peak}}^{'} /
\tau_{\mathrm{RT}}^{'})^{0.842 \pm 0.064}$, where $E_{\mathrm{peak}}^{'}$ and
$\tau_{\mathrm{RT}}^{'}$ denote the peak energy and minimum rise time in the
GRB rest frame. We discussed that what we found can be interpreted/understood
in the framework of the definition of the luminosity (energy released in units
of time). Our argument about the connection between the luminosity relations of
GRBs and the definition of the luminosity provides a clear direction for
exploring tighter luminosity relations of GRBs in the future.

</p>	<p><h3><b>GRB 081029: A Gamma-Ray Burst with a Multi-Component Afterglow. (arXiv:1111.6484v1 [astro-ph.HE])</b></h3></p>	<p><p>We present an analysis of the unusual optical light curve of the gamma-ray
burst GRB 081029, a long-soft burst with a redshift of z = 3.8479. We combine
X-ray and optical observations from the Swift X-Ray Telescope and the Swift
UltraViolet/Optical Telescope with ground-based optical and infrared data
obtained using the REM, ROTSE, and CTIO 1.3-m telescopes to construct a
detailed data set extending from 86 s to approximately 100,000 s after the BAT
trigger. Our data cover a wide energy range, from 10 keV to 0.77 eV (1.24 to
16,000 Angstrom). The X-ray afterglow shows a shallow initial decay followed by
a rapid decay starting at about 18,000 s. The optical and infrared afterglow,
however, shows an uncharacteristic rise at about 3000 s that does not
correspond to any feature in the X-ray light curve. Our data are not consistent
with synchrotron radiation from a jet interacting with an external medium, a
two-component jet, or continuous energy injection from the central engine. We
find that the optical light curves can be broadly explained by a collision
between two ejecta shells within a two-component jet. A growing number of
gamma-ray burst afterglows are consistent with complex jets, which suggests
that some (or all) gamma-ray burst jets are complex and will require detailed
modelling to fully understand them.

</p>	<p><h3><b>Gamma-ray Clues to the Relativistic Jet Dichotomy. (arXiv:1111.6490v1 [astro-ph.HE])</b></h3></p>	<p><p>In examining a select sample of over 200 blazars of known jet kinetic power
(L_kin) and well-characterized SEDs, we found (Meyer et al., 2011) that
Intermediate synchrotron-peaking (ISP) blazars may have lower gamma-ray output
than high synchrotron-peaking (HSP) blazars of similar L_kin, consistent with
our hypothesis that ISP blazars are less-beamed versions of HSP blazars, rather
than a distinct population. Further, by using the radio core dominance as a
measure of relative beaming, we find that gamma-ray luminosity depends on
beaming in a consistent way for blazars ranging over all jet kinetic powers
(10^42 - 10^46 ergs/s). We re-examine the gamma-ray properties of this core
sample of blazars using the 1-year LAT catalog (Abdo et al., 2010). We find
that for weak jets, the ratio of inverse Compton to synchrotron emission
remains constant with increased beaming, consistent with an SSC model for the
jet emission, while the most powerful jets show a strong increase in Compton
dominance with orientation, consistent with an external Compton (EC) emission
model.

</p>	<p><h3><b>Gamma-rays from molecular clouds illuminated by accumulated diffusive protons. II: interacting supernova remnants. (arXiv:1108.4541v3 [astro-ph.HE] UPDATED)</b></h3></p>	<p><p>Recent observations reveal that spectral breaks at ~GeV are commonly present
in Galactic gamma-ray supernova remnants (SNRs) interacting with molecular
clouds and that most of them have a spectral ($E^2dF/dE$) "platform" extended
from the break to lower energies. In paper I (Li &amp; Chen 2010), we developed an
accumulative diffusion model by considering an accumulation of the diffusive
protons escaping from the shock front throughout the history of the SNR
expansion. In this paper, we improve the model by incorporating finite-volume
of MCs, demonstrate the model dependence on particle diffusion parameters and
cloud size, and apply it to nine interacting SNRs (W28, W41, W44, W49B, W51C,
Cygnus Loop, IC443, CTB 37A, and G349.7+0.2). This refined model naturally
explains the GeV spectral breaks and, especially, the "platform"s, together
with available TeV data. We find that the index of the diffusion coeffcient
\delta\ is in the range of 0.5-0.7, similar to the galactic averaged value, and
the diffusion coefficient for cosmic rays around the SNRs is essentially two
orders of magnitude lower than the Galactic average, which is a good indication
for the suppression of cosmic ray diffusion near SNRs.

</p>	<p><h3><b>VERITAS Observations of Gamma-Ray Bursts Detected by Swift. (arXiv:1109.0050v2 [astro-ph.HE] UPDATED)</b></h3></p>	<p><p>We present the results of sixteen Swift-triggered GRB follow-up observations
taken with the VERITAS telescope array from January, 2007 to June, 2009. The
median energy threshold and response time of these observations was 260 GeV and
320 s, respectively. Observations had an average duration of 90 minutes. Each
burst is analyzed independently in two modes: over the whole duration of the
observations and again over a shorter time scale determined by the maximum
VERITAS sensitivity to a burst with a t^-1.5 time profile. This temporal model
is characteristic of GRB afterglows with high-energy, long-lived emission that
have been detected by the Large Area Telescope (LAT) on-board the Fermi
satellite. No significant VHE gamma-ray emission was detected and upper limits
above the VERITAS threshold energy are calculated. The VERITAS upper limits are
corrected for gamma-ray extinction by the extragalactic background light (EBL)
and interpreted in the context of the keV emission detected by Swift. For some
bursts the VHE emission must have less power than the keV emission, placing
constraints on inverse Compton models of VHE emission.

</p>	<p><h3><b>The Very Massive and Hot LMC Star VFTS 682: Progenitor of a Future Dark Gamma-Ray Burst?. (arXiv:1112.0016v1 [astro-ph.GA])</b></h3></p>	<p><p>VFTS 682, a very massive and very hot Wolf-Rayet (WR) star recently
discovered in the Large Magellanic Cloud near the famous star cluster R136,
might be providing us with a glimpse of a missing link in our understanding of
Long Gamma-Ray Bursts (LGRBs), including dark GRBs. It is likely its properties
result from chemically homogeneous evolution (CHE), believed to be a key
process for a massive star to become a GRB. It is also heavily obscured by dust
extinction, which could make it a dark GRB upon explosion. Using Spitzer data
we investigate the properties of interstellar dust in the vicinity of R136, and
argue that its high obscuration is not unusual for its environment and that it
could indeed be a slow runaway ("walkaway") from R136. Unfortunately, based on
its current mass loss rate, VFTS 682 is unlikely to become a GRB, because it
will lose too much angular momentum at its death. If it were to become a GRB,
it probably would also not be dark, either escaping or destroying its
surrounding dusty region. Nevertheless, it is a very interesting star,
deserving further studies, and being one of only three presently identified WR
stars (two others in the Small Magellanic Cloud) that seems to be undergoing
CHE.

has been extensively studied analytically and numerically. In these events the
star develops into an elongated banana-shaped structure. After completing an
eccentric orbit, the bound debris fall onto the black hole, forming an
accretion disk and emitting radiation. The same process may occur on planetary
scales, if a minor body orbits too close to its star. In the Solar System,
comets fall directly onto our Sun or onto planets. If the star is a compact
object, the minor body can become tidally disrupted. Indeed, one of the first
mechanisms invoked to produce strong gamma-ray emission involved accretion of
comets onto neutron stars in our Galaxy. Here we report that the peculiarities
of the `Christmas' gamma-ray burst (GRB 101225A) can be explained by a tidal
disruption event of a minor body around a Galactic isolated neutron star. This
result would indicate either that minor bodies can be captured by compact
stellar remnants more frequently than it occurs in our Solar System or that
minor body formation is relatively easy around millisecond radio pulsars. A
peculiar Supernova associated to a GRB may provide an alternative explanation.

</p>	<p><h3><b>Relation of Astrophysical Turbulence and Magnetic Reconnection. (arXiv:1112.0022v1 [astro-ph.GA])</b></h3></p>	<p><p>Astrophysical fluids are generically turbulent and this must be taken into
account for most transport processes. We discuss how the preexisting turbulence
modifies magnetic reconnection and how magnetic reconnection affects the MHD
turbulent cascade. We show the intrinsic interdependence and interrelation of
magnetic turbulence and magnetic reconnection, in particular, that strong
magnetic turbulence in 3D requires reconnection and 3D magnetic turbulence
entails fast reconnection. We follow the approach in Eyink, Lazarian &amp; Vishniac
2011 to show that the expressions of fast magnetic reconnection in Lazarian &amp;
Vishniac 1999 can be recovered if Richardson diffusion of turbulent flows is
used instead of ordinary Ohmic diffusion. This does not revive, however, the
concept of magnetic turbulent diffusion which assumes that magnetic fields can
be mixed up in a passive way down to a very small dissipation scales. On the
contrary, we are dealing the reconnection of dynamically important magnetic
field bundles which strongly resist bending and have well defined mean
direction weakly perturbed by turbulence. We argue that in the presence of
turbulence the very concept of flux-freezing requires modification. The
diffusion that arises from magnetic turbulence can be called reconnection
diffusion as it based on reconnection of magnetic field lines. The reconnection
diffusion has important implications for the continuous transport processes in
magnetized plasmas and for star formation. In addition, fast magnetic
reconnection in turbulent media induces the First order Fermi acceleration of
energetic particles, can explain solar flares and gamma ray bursts. However,
the most dramatic consequence of these developments is the fact that the
standard flux freezing concept must be radically modified in the presence of
turbulence.

</p>	<p><h3><b>BL Lacertae objects beyond redshift 1.3 - UV-to-NIR photometry and photometric redshift for Fermi/LAT blazars. (arXiv:1112.0025v1 [astro-ph.CO])</b></h3></p>	<p><p>Observations of the gamma-ray sky with Fermi led to significant advances
towards understanding blazars, the most extreme class of Active Galactic
Nuclei. A large fraction of the population detected by Fermi is formed by BL
Lacertae (BL Lac) objects, whose sample has always suffered from a severe
redshift incompleteness due to the quasi-featureless optical spectra. Our goal
is to provide a significant increase of the number of confirmed high-redshift
BL Lac objects contained in the 2 LAC Fermi/LAT catalog. For 103 Fermi/LAT
blazars, photometric redshifts using spectral energy distribution fitting have
been obtained. The photometry includes 13 broad-band filters from the far
ultraviolet to the near-IR observed with Swift/UVOT and the multi-channel
imager GROND at the MPG/ESO 2.2m telescope. Data have been taken
quasi-simultaneously and the remaining source-intrinsic variability has been
corrected for. We release the UV-to-near-IR 13-band photometry for all 103
sources and provide redshift constraints for 75 sources without previously
known redshift. Out of those, eight have reliable photometric redshifts at
z&gt;1.3, while for the other 67 sources we provide upper limits. Six of the
former eight are BL Lac objects, which quadruples the sample of confirmed
high-redshift BL Lac. This includes three sources with redshifts higher than
the previous record for BL Lac, including CRATES J0402-2615 with the best-fit
solution at z~1.9.

number of signals laying on different angular scales: point-like and extended
gamma-ray sources, diffuse emissions, as well as large and intermediate scale
cosmic-ray anisotropies. The separation of all these contributions is crucial,
mostly when they overlap with each other. Needlets are a form of spherical
wavelets that have recently drawn a lot of attention in the cosmological
literature, especially in connection with the analysis of CMB data. Needlets
enjoy a number of important statistical and numerical properties which suggest
that they can be very effective in handling cosmic-ray and gamma-ray data
analysis. An application of needlets to astroparticle physics is shown here. In
particular, light will be thrown on how useful they might be for estimating
background and foreground contributions. Since such an estimation is expected
to be optimal or nearly-optimal in a well-defined mathematical sense, needlets
turn out to be a powerful method for unbiased point-source detections. In this
paper needlets were applied to two distinct simulated datasets, for satellite
and EAS array experiments, both large field of view telescopes. Results will be
compared to those achievable with standard analysis tecniques in any of these

</p>	<p><h3><b>The 2010 very high energy gamma-ray flare & 10 years of multi-wavelength observations of M 87. (arXiv:1111.5341v1 [astro-ph.CO])</b></h3></p>	<p><p>Abridged: The giant radio galaxy M 87 with its proximity, famous jet, and
very massive black hole provides a unique opportunity to investigate the origin
of very high energy (VHE; E&gt;100 GeV) gamma-ray emission generated in
relativistic outflows and the surroundings of super-massive black holes. M 87
has been established as a VHE gamma-ray emitter since 2006. The VHE gamma-ray
emission displays strong variability on timescales as short as a day. In this
paper, results from a joint VHE monitoring campaign on M 87 by the MAGIC and
VERITAS instruments in 2010 are reported. During the campaign, a flare at VHE
was detected triggering further observations at VHE (H.E.S.S.), X-rays
(Chandra), and radio (43 GHz VLBA). The excellent sampling of the VHE gamma-ray
light curve enables one to derive a precise temporal characterization of the
flare: the single, isolated flare is well described by a two-sided exponential
function with significantly different flux rise and decay times. While the
overall variability pattern of the 2010 flare appears somewhat different from
that of previous VHE flares in 2005 and 2008, they share very similar
timescales (~day), peak fluxes (Phi(&gt;0.35 TeV) ~= (1-3) x 10^-11 ph cm^-2
s^-1), and VHE spectra. 43 GHz VLBA radio observations of the inner jet regions
indicate no enhanced flux in 2010 in contrast to observations in 2008, where an
increase of the radio flux of the innermost core regions coincided with a VHE
flare. On the other hand, Chandra X-ray observations taken ~3 days after the
peak of the VHE gamma-ray emission reveal an enhanced flux from the core. The
long-term (2001-2010) multi-wavelength light curve of M 87, spanning from radio
to VHE and including data from HST, LT, VLA and EVN, is used to further
investigate the origin of the VHE gamma-ray emission. No unique, common MWL
signature of the three VHE flares has been identified.

</p>	<p><h3><b>The 2010 M 87 VHE flare and its origin: the multi-wavelength picture. (arXiv:1111.5344v1 [astro-ph.CO])</b></h3></p>	<p><p>The giant radio galaxy M 87, with its proximity (16 Mpc) and its very massive
black hole ((3 - 6) \times 10^9 M_solar), provides a unique laboratory to
investigate very high energy (E&gt;100 GeV; VHE) gamma-ray emission from active
galactic nuclei and, thereby, probe particle acceleration to relativistic
energies near supermassive black holes (SMBH) and in relativistic jets. M 87
has been established as a VHE gamma-ray emitter since 2005. The VHE gamma-ray
emission displays strong variability on timescales as short as a day. In 2008,
a rise in the 43 GHz Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) radio emission of the
innermost region (core; extension of &lt; 100 Rs ; Schwarzschild radii) was found
to coincide with a flaring activity at VHE. This had been interpreted as a
strong indication that the VHE emission is produced in the direct vicinity of
the SMBH. In 2010 a flare at VHE was again detected triggering further
multi-wavelength (MWL) observations with the VLBA, Chandra, and other
instruments. At the same time, M 87 was also observed with the Fermi-LAT
telescope at MeV/GeV energies, the European VLBI Network (EVN), and the
Liverpool Telescope (LT). Here, preliminary results from the 2010 campaign will
be reported.

</p>	<p><h3><b>Spectral and spatial observations of microwave spikes and zebra structure in the short radio burst of May 29, 2003. (arXiv:1111.5405v1 [astro-ph.SR])</b></h3></p>	<p><p>The unusual radio burst of May 29, 2003 connected with the M1.5 flare in AR
10368 has been analyzed. It was observed by the Solar Broadband Radio
Spectrometer (SBRS/Huairou station, Beijing) in the 5.2-7.6 GHz range. It
proved to be only the third case of a neat zebra structure appearing among all
observations at such high frequencies. Despite the short duration of the burst
(25 s), it provided a wealth of data for studying the superfine structure with
millisecond resolution (5 ms). We localize the site of emission sources in the
flare region, estimate plasma parameters in the generation sites, and suggest
applicable mechanisms for interpretating spikes and zebra-structure generation.
Positions of radio bursts were obtained by the Siberian Solar Radio Telescope
(SSRT) (5.7 GHz) and Nobeyama radioheliograph (NoRH) (17 GHz). The sources in
intensity gravitated to tops of short loops at 17 GHz, and to long loops at 5.7
GHz. Short pulses at 17 GHz (with a temporal resolution of 100 ms) are
registered in the R-polarized source over the N-magnetic polarity
(extraordinary mode). Dynamic spectra show that all the emission comprised
millisecond pulses (spikes) of 5-10 ms duration in the instantaneous band of 70
to 100 MHz, forming the superfine structure of different bursts, essentially in
the form of fast or slow-drift fibers and various zebra-structure stripes. Five
scales of zebra structures have been singled out. As the main mechanism for
generating spikes (as the initial emission) we suggest the coalescence of
plasma waves with whistlers in the pulse regime of interaction between
whistlers and ion-sound waves. In this case one can explain the appearance of
fibers and sporadic zebra-structure stripes exhibiting the frequency splitting.

emission-line galaxies with very red 3.4mum - 4.6mum (W1-W2) colours in the
Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) Preliminary Release Source Catalogue
(PRSC) aiming to find objects with hot dust emission. For this purpose we
considered a sample of ~16000 galaxies with strong emission lines selected out
of a total of ~900000 SDSS spectra and identified them with the PRSC sources.
We find that ~5000 sources out of the ~16000 SDSS galaxies are present in the
PRSC, including ~1000 galaxies with sufficiently strong [OIII]4363 emission
lines to permit reliable determinations of the oxygen abundance. No correlation
of W1-W2 with metallicity is found. On the other hand, there is clear evidence
for a redder W1-W2 index in galaxies with higher Hbeta luminosity and higher
Hbeta equivalent width, implying that strong UV radiation from young starbursts
efficiently heats interstellar dust to high temperatures. However, galaxies
with very red colours W1-W2&gt;2 mag, similar to that in the local extreme
star-forming galaxy SBS 0335-052E, are very rare. In addition to three
previously known sources, which are not present in our sample, we found only
four such galaxies.

</p>	<p><h3><b>UHE neutrinos from Pop III stars: concept and constraints. (arXiv:1111.5461v1 [astro-ph.HE])</b></h3></p>	<p><p>We reconsider the model of neutrino production during the 'bright phase',
first suggested in 1977, in the light of modern understanding of the role of
Pop III stars and acceleration of particles in supernova shocks. We concentrate
on the production of cosmogenic UHE neutrinos in supernova explosions that
accompany the death of Pop III stars. Accelerated protons produce neutrinos in
collisions with CMB photons. We deliberately use simplified assumptions which
make our results transparent. Pop III stars are assumed to be responsible for
the reionization of the universe as observed by WMAP. Since the evolution of
Pop III stars is much faster than the Hubble rate, we consider the burst of UHE
proton production to occur at fixed redshift (z_b=10-20). We discuss the
formation of collisionless shocks and particle acceleration in the early
universe. The composition of accelerated particles is expected to be proton
dominated. A simple calculation is presented to illustrate the fact that the
diffuse neutrinos flux from the bright phase burst is concentrated in a
relatively narrow range around $7.5 \times 10^{15}(20/z_b)^2$ eV. The $\nu_\mu$
flux may be detectable by IceCube without violating the cascade upper limit and
the expected energetics of SNe associated with Pop III stars. A possible
signature of the neutrino production from Pop III stars may be the detection of
resonant neutrino events. For the burst at $z_b=20$ and $\bar{\nu}_e$-flux at
the cascade upper limit, the number of resonant events in IceCube may be as
high as 10 events in 5 years of observations. These events have equal energies,
$E=6.3\times 10^{15}$ eV, in the form of e-m cascades. Given the large
uncertainties in the existing predictions of UHE cosmogenic neutrino fluxes, we
argue that neutrinos from the first stars might become one of the most reliable
hopes for UHE neutrino astronomy.

</p>	<p><h3><b>Investigation of the Progenitors of Nova Explosions. (arXiv:1111.5524v1 [astro-ph.SR])</b></h3></p>	<p><p>Recurrent novae (RNe) play an important role as one of the suspected
progenitor systems of Type Ia supernovae (SNe) which are used as primary
distance indicators in cosmology. Thus, it is important to investigate the
nature of their central binary systems to determine the relation between the
parameters of the central system and outburst type, and finally ascertain the
population of novae that might be available to give rise to the progenitors of
Type Ia SNe. The details of the preliminary investigation looking for
characteristics that may distinguish recurrent and classical novae (CNe)
systems, the selection of initial targets for detailed study, and preliminary
results are presented. We identify 10 suspected RNe among the Galactic CNe
population and our initial photometric observations of their quiescent systems
suggest 2 may belong to the RS Oph type and 2 to the U Sco type RNe.
Spectroscopic follow-up is now underway.

The light curve shows two normal outbursts with recurrence time ~ 40 days and

</p>	<p><h3><b>Constraining Cosmic Rays and Magnetic Fields in the Perseus Galaxy Cluster with TeV observations by the MAGIC telescopes. (arXiv:1111.5544v1 [astro-ph.HE])</b></h3></p>	<p><p>Galaxy clusters are being assembled today in the most energetic phase of
hierarchical structure formation which manifests itself in powerful shocks that
contribute to a substantial energy density of cosmic rays (CRs). Hence,
clusters are expected to be luminous gamma-ray emitters since they also act as
energy reservoirs for additional CR sources, such as active galactic nuclei and
supernova-driven galactic winds. To detect the gamma-ray emission from CR
interactions with the ambient cluster gas, we conducted the deepest to date
observational campaign targeting a galaxy cluster at very high-energy
gamma-rays and observed the Perseus cluster with the MAGIC Cherenkov telescopes
for a total of ~85 hr of effective observing time. This campaign resulted in
the detection of the central radio galaxy NGC 1275 at energies E &gt; 100 GeV with
a very steep energy spectrum. Here, we restrict our analysis to energies E &gt;
630 GeV and detect no significant gamma-ray excess. This constrains the average
CR-to-thermal pressure ratio to be &lt;= 1-2%, depending on assumptions and the
model for CR emission. Comparing these gamma-ray upper limits to predictions
from cosmological cluster simulations that include CRs constrains the maximum
CR acceleration efficiency at structure formation shocks to be &lt; 50%.
Alternatively, this may argue for non-negligible CR transport processes such as
CR streaming and diffusion into the outer cluster regions. Finally, we derive
lower limits on the magnetic field distribution assuming that the Perseus radio
mini-halo is generated by secondary electrons/positrons that are created in
hadronic CR interactions: assuming a spectrum of E^-2.2 around TeV energies as
implied by cluster simulations, we limit the central magnetic field to be &gt; 4-9
microG, depending on the rate of decline of the magnetic field strength toward
larger radii.

Cherenkov telescopes in the Southern hemisphere, designed to observe very high

search for annihilations of Dark Matter particles in dense environments. Dwarf
galaxy dynamics shows that they are Dark Matter-dominated environments. Several
observation campaigns on dwarf satellite galaxies of the Milky Way were
launched by H.E.S.S.. The observations are reviewed. In the absence of clear
signals, constraints on the Dark Matter particle annihilation cross-section
have been derived in different particle physics scenarios. Some possible
enhancements of the gamma-ray flux are studied, i.e., the Sommerfeld effect,
the internal bremsstrahlung and the substructures in the Dark Matter halo.

</p>	<p><h3><b>The Galactic Center region viewed by H.E.S.S. (arXiv:1111.5783v1 [astro-ph.HE])</b></h3></p>	<p><p>The Galactic center region is the most active region in the Milky Way
harboring a wealth of photon sources at all wavelengths. H.E.S.S. observations
of the Galactic Center (GC) region revealed for the first time in very high
energy (VHE, E&gt; 100 GeV) gamma-rays a detailed view of the innermost 100 pc of
the Milky Way and provided a valuable probe for the acceleration processes and
propagation of energetic particles near the GC. H.E.S.S. has taken more than
180 hours of good-quality observations toward the GC region since the
experience started in 2003. A strong and steady gamma-ray source has been
detected coincident in position with the supermassive black hole Sgr A*.
Besides the central pointlike source, a diffuse emission extended along the
Galactic Plane has been detected within about 1$^{\circ}$ around the GC. An
accurate analysis of the Galactic center region suggests that the diffuse
emission may dominate highest energy end of the overall GC source spectrum. I
will review the current VHE view by H.E.S.S. of the GC region and briefly
discuss the theoretical models which explain VHE gamma-ray emissions of the
central source and the diffuse emission.

</p>	<p><h3><b>In pursuit of gamma-ray burst progenitors: the identification of a sub-population of rotating Wolf-Rayet stars. (arXiv:1111.5806v1 [astro-ph.SR])</b></h3></p>	<p><p>Long gamma-ray bursts involve the most powerful cosmic explosions since the
Big Bang. Whilst it has been established that GRBs are related to the death
throes of massive stars, the identification of their progenitors has proved
challenging. Theory suggests that rotating Wolf-Rayet stars are the best
candidates, but their strong stellar winds shroud their surfaces, preventing a
direct measurement of their rotation. Fortunately, linear spectropolarimetry
may be used to probe the flattening of their winds due to stellar spin.
Spectropolarimetry surveys show that an 80% majority of WR stars have
spherically symmetric winds and are thus rotating slowly, yet a small 20%
minority display a spectropolarimetric signature indicative of rotation. Here
we find a highly significant correlation between WR objects that carry the
signature of stellar rotation and the subset of WR stars with ejecta nebulae
that have only recently transitioned from a red sugergiant or luminous blue
variable phase. As these youthful WR stars have yet to spin-down due to mass
loss, they are the best candidate GRB progenitors identified to date. When we
take recently published WR ejecta nebula numbers we find that five out of the
six line-effect WR stars are surrounded by ejecta nebulae. The statistics imply
that the null hypothesis of no correlation between line-effect WR stars and
ejecta nebulae can be rejected at the 0.0004% level. Given that four
line-effect and WR ejecta nebula have spectroscopically been confirmed to
contain nucleosynthetic products, we argue that the correlation is both
statistically significant and physically convincing. The implication is that we
have identified a WR sub-population that fulfills the necessary criteria for
making GRBs. Finally, we discuss the potential of identifying GRB progenitors
via spectropolarimetry with extremely large telescopes.

</p>	<p><h3><b>Search for a simultaneous signal from small transient events in the Pierre Auger Observatory and the Tupi muon telescopes. (arXiv:1111.6076v1 [astro-ph.SR])</b></h3></p>	<p><p>We present results of a search for a possible signal from small scale solar
transient events (such as flares and interplanetary shocks) as well as possible
counterparts to Gamma-Ray Burst (GRB) observed simultaneously by the Tupi muon
telescope Niteroi-Brazil, 22.90S, 43.20W, 3 m above sea level) and the Pierre
Auger Observatory surface detectors (Malargue-Argentina, 69.30S, 35.30W,
altitude 1400 m). Both cosmic ray experiments are located inside the South
Atlantic Anomaly (SAA) region. Our analysis of several examples shows
similarities in the behavior of the counting rate of low energy (above 100 MeV)
particles in association with the solar activity (solar flares and
interplanetary shocks). We also report an observation by the Tupi experiment of
the enhancement of muons at ground level with a significance higher than 8
sigma in the 1-sec binning counting rate (raw data) in close time coincidence
(T-184 sec) with the Swift-BAT GRB110928B (trigger=504307). The GRB 110928B
coordinates are in the field of view of the vertical Tupi telescope, and the
burst was close to the MAXI source J1836-194. The 5-min muon counting rate in
the vertical Tupi telescope as well as publicly available data from Auger (15
minutes averages of the scaler rates) show small peaks above the background
fluctuations at the time following the Swift-BAT GRB 110928B trigger. In
accordance with the long duration trigger, this signal can possibly suggest a
long GRB, with a precursor narrow peak at T-184 sec.

are critical to understand some of the most relevant current problems of high
energy astrophysics of blazars such as their high energy emission mechanisms
and the location of their gamma-ray emission region through event associations
across the spectrum. Adding multi-spectral-range polarimetry allows for even
more reliable identification of polarized flares across the spectrum in these
kind of objects, as well as for more accurate modeling of their magnetic field.
As part of a major international effort to study the long term multi-spectral
range polarimetric behavior of blazars, MAPCAT uses -since mid 2007- CAFOS on
the 2.2m Telescope at the Calar Alto Observatory (Almeria, Spain) to obtain
monthly optical (R-band) photo-polarimetric measurements of a sample of 34 of
the brightest gamma-ray, optical, and radio-millimeter blazars accessible from
the northern hemisphere.

</p>	<p><h3><b>Gamma-Ray Burst Dynamics and Afterglow Radiation from Adaptive Mesh Refinement, Special Relativistic Hydrodynamic Simulations. (arXiv:1111.6890v1 [astro-ph.HE])</b></h3></p>	<p><p>We report on the development of Mezcal-SRHD, a new adaptive mesh refinement,
special relativistic hydrodynamics (SRHD) code, developed with the aim of
studying the highly relativistic flows in Gamma-Ray Burst sources. The SRHD
equations are solved using finite volume conservative solvers. The correct
implementation of the algorithms is verified by one-dimensional (1D) shock tube
and multidimensional tests. The code is then applied to study the propagation
of 1D spherical impulsive blast waves expanding in a stratified medium with
$\rho \propto r^{-k}$, bridging between the relativistic and Newtonian phases,
as well as to a two-dimensional (2D) cylindrically symmetric impulsive jet
propagating in a constant density medium. It is shown that the deceleration to
non-relativistic speeds in one-dimension occurs on scales significantly larger
than the Sedov length. This transition is further delayed with respect to the
Sedov length as the degree of stratification of the ambient medium is
increased. This result, together with the scaling of position, Lorentz factor
and the shock velocity as a function of time and shock radius, is explained
here using a simple analytical model based on energy conservation. The method
used for calculating the afterglow radiation by post-processing the results of
the simulations is described in detail. The light curves computed using the
results of 1D numerical simulations during the relativistic stage correctly
reproduce those calculated assuming the self-similar Blandford-McKee solution
for the evolution of the flow. The jet dynamics from our 2D simulations and the
resulting afterglow lightcurves, including the jet break, are in good agreement
with those presented in previous works. Finally, we show how the details of the
dynamics critically depend on properly resolving the structure of the
relativistic flow.

</p>	<p><h3><b>A new three-parameter correlation for gamma-ray bursts with a plateau phase in the afterglow. (arXiv:1103.3978v3 [astro-ph.HE] UPDATED)</b></h3></p>	<p><p>Gamma ray bursts (GRBs) have great advantages for their huge burst energies,
luminosities and high redshifts in probing the Universe. A few interesting
luminosity correlations of GRBs have been used to test cosmology models.
Especially, for a subsample of long GRBs with known redshifts and a plateau
phase in the afterglow, a correlation between the end time of the plateau phase
(in the GRB rest frame) and the corresponding X-ray luminosity has been found.
In this paper, we re-analyze the subsample and found that a significantly
tighter correlation exists when we add a third parameter, i.e. the isotropic
$\gamma$-ray energy release, into the consideration. Additionally, both long
and intermediate duration GRBs are consistent with the same three-parameter
correlation equation. It is argued that the new three-parameter correlation is
consistent with the hypothesis that the subsample of GRBs with a plateau phase
in the afterglow be associated with the birth of rapidly rotating magnetars,
and that the plateau be due to the continuous energy-injection from the
magnetar. It is suggested that the newly born millisecond magnetars associated
with GRBs might provide a good standard candle in the Universe.

cosmic-ray spectrum are plagued by the question of how to disentangle a dark
matter signal from the omnipresent astrophysical background. One of the
practically background-free smoking-gun signatures for dark matter would be the
observation of a sharp cutoff or a pronounced bump in the gamma-ray energy

</p>	<p><h3><b>Searching for soft relativistic jets in Core-collapse Supernovae with the IceCube Optical Follow-up Program. (arXiv:1111.7030v1 [astro-ph.HE])</b></h3></p>	<p><p>Context. Transient neutrino sources such as Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) and
Supernovae (SNe) are hypothesized to emit bursts of high-energy neutrinos on a
time-scale of \lesssim 100 s. While GRB neutrinos would be produced in high
relativistic jets, core-collapse SNe might host soft-relativistic jets, which
become stalled in the outer layers of the progenitor star leading to an
efficient production of high-energy neutrinos. Aims. To increase the
sensitivity to these neutrinos and identify their sources, a low-threshold
optical follow-up program for neutrino multiplets detected with the IceCube
observatory has been implemented. Methods. If a neutrino multiplet, i.e. two or
more neutrinos from the same direction within 100 s, is found by IceCube a
trigger is sent to the Robotic Optical Transient Search Experiment, ROTSE. The
4 ROTSE telescopes immediately start an observation program of the
corresponding region of the sky in order to detect an optical counterpart to
the neutrino events. Results. No statistically significant excess in the rate
of neutrino multiplets has been observed and furthermore no coincidence with an
optical counterpart was found. Conclusion. The search allows, for the first
time, to set stringent limits on current models predicting a high-energy
neutrino flux from soft relativistic hadronic jets in core-collapse SNe. We
conclude that a sub-population of SNe with typical Lorentz boost factor and jet
energy of 10 and 3\times10^{51} erg, respectively, does not exceed 4.2% at 90%
confidence.

</p>	<p><h3><b>Particle acceleration at relativistic shock waves. (arXiv:1111.7110v1 [astro-ph.HE])</b></h3></p>	<p><p>Relativistic sources, e.g. gamma-ray bursts, pulsar wind nebulae and powerful
active galactic nuclei produce relativistic outflows that lead to the formation
of collisionless shock waves, where particle acceleration is thought to take
place. Our understanding of relativistic shock acceleration has improved in the
past decade, thanks to the combination of analytical studies and high level
numerical simulations. In ultra-relativistic shocks, particle acceleration is
made difficult by the generically transverse magnetic field and large advection
speed of the shocked plasma. Fast growing microturbulence is thus needed to
make the Fermi process operative. It is thought, and numerical simulations
support that view, that the penetration of supra-thermal particles in the shock
precursor generates a magnetic turbulence which in turn produces the scattering
process needed for particle acceleration through the Fermi mechanism. Through
the comparison of the growth timescale of the microinstabilities in the shock
precursor and the precursor crossing timescale, it is possible to delimit in
terms of magnetization and shock Lorentz factor the region in which
micro-turbulence may be excited, hence whether and how Fermi acceleration is
triggered. These findings are summarized here and astrophysical consequences
are drawn.

as a source of short gamma-ray burst (sGRB) precursors. We find that the
driving of a crust-core interface mode can lead to shattering of the NS crust,
liberating ~10^46-10^47 erg of energy seconds before the merger of a NS-NS or
NS-black hole binary. Such properties are consistent with Swift/BAT detections
of sGRB precursors, and we use the timing of the observed precursors to place
weak constraints on the crust equation of state. We describe how a larger
sample of precursor detections could be used alongside coincident gravitational
wave detections of the inspiral by Advanced LIGO class detectors to probe the
NS structure. These two types of observations nicely complement one another,
since the former constrains the equation of state and structure near the
crust-core boundary, while the latter is more sensitive to the core equation of

massive stars. Interactions of cosmic rays with interstellar gas and radiation
fields make it shine at gamma-ray energies. Several gamma-ray pulsars and other
energetic sources are seen in this direction. In this paper we analyse the
gamma-ray emission measured by the Fermi Large Area Telescope in the energy
range from 100 MeV to 100 GeV in order to probe the gas and cosmic-ray content
over the scale of the whole Cygnus complex. The signal from bright pulsars is
largely reduced by selecting photons in their off-pulse phase intervals. We
compare the diffuse gamma-ray emission with interstellar gas maps derived from
radio/mm-wave lines and visual extinction data, and a global model of the
region, including other pulsars and gamma-ray sources, is sought. The integral
HI emissivity and its spectral energy distribution are both consistent within
the systematics with LAT measurements in the interstellar space near the solar
system. The average X=N(H2)/W(CO) ratio is consistent with other LAT
measurements in the Local Arm. We detect significant gamma-ray emission from
dark neutral gas for a mass corresponding to ~40% of that traced by CO. Despite
the conspicuous star formation activity and large masses of the interstellar
clouds, the cosmic-ray population in the Cygnus complex averaged over a few
hundred parsecs is similar to that of the local interstellar space. (abridged)
