V<p>[abridged] While observations of Local Group galaxies show a very simple,\u000alocal star formation law in which the star formation rate per unit area in each\u000apatch of a galaxy scales linearly with the molecular gas surface density,\u000arecent observations of both Milky Way molecular clouds and high redshift\u000agalaxies apparently show a more complicated relationship, in which regions of\u000aequal surface density can form stars at quite different rates. These data have\u000abeen interpreted as implying either that different star formation laws apply in\u000adifferent circumstances, that the star formation law is sensitive to\u000alarge-scale galaxy properties rather than local properties, or that there are\u000ahigh density thresholds for star formation. Here we collate resolved\u000aobservations of Milky Way molecular clouds, kpc-scale observations of Local\u000aGroup galaxies, and unresolved observations of both disk and starburst galaxies\u000ain the local universe and at high redshift. We show that all of these data are\u000ain fact consistent with a simple, local, volumetric star formation law. The\u000aapparent variations stem from the fact that the observed objects have a wide\u000avariety of 3D size scales and degrees of internal clumping, so even at fixed\u000agas column density the regions being observed can have wildly varying volume\u000adensities. We provide a simple theoretical framework to remove this projection\u000aeffect, and we show that all the data, from small Solar neighborhood clouds\u000awith masses ~10^3 Msun to sub-mm galaxies with masses ~10^11 Msun, fall on a\u000asingle star formation law in which the SFR is simply ~1% of the molecular gas\u000amass per local free-fall time. In contrast, proposed star formation laws in\u000awhich the star formation timescale is set by the galactic rotation period or\u000athe SFR is linearly proportional to the gas mass above some density threshold\u000afail to match at least some of the data.\u000a</p>

V<p>We present a comprehensive analysis of the rest-frame UV to near-IR spectral\u000aenergy distributions and rest-frame optical spectra of four of the brightest\u000agravitationally lensed galaxies in the literature: RCSGA 032727-132609 at\u000az=1.70, MS1512-cB58 at z=2.73, SGAS J152745.1+065219 at z=2.76 and SGAS\u000aJ122651.3+215220 at z=2.92. This includes new Spitzer imaging for RCSGA0327 as\u000awell as new spectra, near-IR imaging and Spitzer imaging for SGAS1527 and\u000aSGAS1226. Lensing magnifications of 3-4 magnitudes allow a detailed study of\u000athe stellar populations and physical conditions. We compare star formation\u000arates as measured from the SED fit, the H-alpha and [OII] emission lines, and\u000athe UV+IR bolometric luminosity where 24 micron photometry is available. The\u000aSFR estimate from the SED fit is consistently higher than the other indicators,\u000awhich suggests that the Calzetti dust extinction law used in the SED fitting is\u000atoo flat for young star-forming galaxies at z~2. Our analysis finds similar\u000astellar population parameters for all four lensed galaxies: stellar masses\u000a3-7*10^9 M_sun, young ages ~ 100 Myr, little dust content E(B-V)=0.10-0.25, and\u000astar formation rates around 20-100 M_sun/yr. Compared to typical values for the\u000agalaxy population at z~2, this suggests we are looking at newly formed,\u000astarbursting systems that have only recently started the build-up of stellar\u000amass. These results constitute the first detailed, uniform analysis of a sample\u000aof the growing number of strongly lensed galaxies known at z~2.\u000a</p>

V<p>We study the metallicity properties of galaxies in the zCOSMOS sample between\u000a0.2&lt;z&lt;0.8. At z&lt;0.46, where Ha and [NII] are detected, we find the same\u000adependence of metallicity on stellar mass and Star Formation Rate (SFR), the\u000aFundamental Metallicity Relation, found by Mannucci et al. (2010) in SDSS\u000agalaxies on a similar redshift range. We extend this relation to higher\u000aredshift, 0.49&lt;z&lt;0.8 where the R23 metallicity index can be measured in our\u000adata, finding no evidence for evolution, and a metallicity scatter around the\u000arelation of about 0.16 dex. This result confirms, with a much higher level of\u000asignificance with respect to previous works, the absence of evolution of the\u000aFMR during the last half of cosmic history.\u000a</p>
