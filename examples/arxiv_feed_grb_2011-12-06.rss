V<p>Following the discovery of a new radio component right before the GeV\u000a\u005cgamma-ray detection since 2008 August by Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope, we\u000apresent a detailed study of the kinematics and lightcurve on the central sub-pc\u000ascale of 3C 84 using the archival VLBA 43-GHz data covering the period between\u000a2002 January to 2008 November. We find that the new component "C3", previously\u000areported by the observations with the VLBI Exploration of Radio Astrometry\u000a(VERA), was already formed in 2003. The flux density of C3 increases moderately\u000auntil 2008, and then it becomes brighter rapidly after 2008. The radio core,\u000aC1, also shows a similar trend. The apparent speed of C3 with reference to the\u000acore C1 shows moderate acceleration from 0.10c to 0.47c between 2003 November\u000ato 2008 November, but is still sub-relativistic. We further try to fit the\u000aobserved broadband spectrum by the one-zone synchrotron self-Compton (SSC)\u000amodel using the measured apparent speed of C3. The fit can reproduce the\u000aobserved \u005cgamma-ray emission, but does not agree with the observed radio\u000aspectral index between 22 and 43 GHz.\u000a</p>

V<p>Astrophysical sources of TeV gamma rays are usually established by Cherenkov\u000atelescope observations. These counting type instruments have a field of view of\u000afew degrees in diameter and record large numbers of particle air showers via\u000atheir Cherenkov radiation in the atmosphere. The showers are either induced by\u000agamma rays or diffuse cosmic ray background. The commonly used test statistic\u000ato evaluate a possible gamma-ray excess is Li and Ma (1983), Eq. 17, which can\u000abe applied to independent on- and off-source observations, or scenarios that\u000acan be approximated as such. This formula however is unsuitable if the data are\u000ataken in so-called "wobble" mode (pointing to several offset positions around\u000athe source), if at the same time the acceptance shape is irregular or even\u000adepends on the pointing direction. To provide a robust test statistic in such\u000acases, this paper explores a possible generalization of the likelihood ratio\u000aconcept on which the formula of Li and Ma is based. In doing so, we fully\u000aexploit the multi-pointing nature of the data and the typically known\u000ainstrument point spread function to derive a new, seminumerical test statistic.\u000aDue to its flexibility and robustness against systematic uncertainties, it is\u000anot only useful for detection purposes, but also for skymapping and source\u000ashape fitting.

V<p>We present the analysis of a large sample of Gamma-ray burst (GRB) X-ray\u000alight curves in the rest frame to characterise their intrinsic properties in\u000athe context of different theoretical scenarios. We determine the morphology,\u000atime-scales and energetics of 64 long GRBs observed by Swift/XRT without\u000aflaring activity. We furthermore provide a one-to-one comparison to the\u000aproperties of GRBs with X-ray flares. We find that the steep decay morphology\u000aand its connection with X-ray flares favor a scenario in which a central engine\u000aorigin, as proposed by Kumar et al. (2008). We show that this scenario can\u000aaccount also for the shallow decay phase, provided that the GRB progenitor star\u000ahas a self-similar structure with a constant envelope to core mass ratio $\u005csim\u000a0.02-0.03$. However, difficulties arise for very long duration\u000a($t_p\u005cgtrsim10^4$ s) shallow phases. Alternatively, a spinning-down magnetar\u000awhose emitted power refreshes the forward shock can quantitatively account for\u000athe shallow decay properties. In particular we demonstrate that this model can\u000aaccount for the plateau luminosity vs. end time anticorrelation found by\u000aDainotti et al. (2008, 2010).\u000a</p>

V<p>Microquasars have been expected to emit high energy gamma-rays due to their\u000ageneral similarities to the gamma-ray emitting blazars (evidences of\u000arelativistic jets, non-thermal radio to X-ray emission).

As these youthful WR stars have yet to spin-down due to mass\u000aloss, they are the best candidate GRB progenitors identified to date.

V<p>Observations of the gamma-ray sky with Fermi led to significant advances\u000atowards understanding blazars, the most extreme class of Active Galactic\u000aNuclei. A large fraction of the population detected by Fermi is formed by BL\u000aLacertae (BL Lac) objects, whose sample has always suffered from a severe\u000aredshift incompleteness due to the quasi-featureless optical spectra. Our goal\u000ais to provide a significant increase of the number of confirmed high-redshift\u000aBL Lac objects contained in the 2 LAC Fermi/LAT catalog. For 103 Fermi/LAT\u000ablazars, photometric redshifts using spectral energy distribution fitting have\u000abeen obtained. The photometry includes 13 broad-band filters from the far\u000aultraviolet to the near-IR observed with Swift/UVOT and the multi-channel\u000aimager GROND at the MPG/ESO 2.2m telescope. Data have been taken\u000aquasi-simultaneously and the remaining source-intrinsic variability has been\u000acorrected for. We release the UV-to-near-IR 13-band photometry for all 103\u000asources and provide redshift constraints for 75 sources without previously\u000aknown redshift. Out of those, eight have reliable photometric redshifts at\u000az&gt;1.3, while for the other 67 sources we provide upper limits. Six of the\u000aformer eight are BL Lac objects, which quadruples the sample of confirmed\u000ahigh-redshift BL Lac. This includes three sources with redshifts higher than\u000athe previous record for BL Lac, including CRATES J0402-2615 with the best-fit\u000asolution at z~1.9.\u000a</p>

For 103 Fermi/LAT\u000ablazars, photometric redshifts using spectral energy distribution fitting have\u000abeen obtained. The photometry includes 13 broad-band filters from the far\u000aultraviolet to the near-IR observed with Swift/UVOT and the multi-channel\u000aimager GROND at the MPG/ESO 2.2m telescope. Data have been taken\u000aquasi-simultaneously and the remaining source-intrinsic variability has been\u000acorrected for. We release the UV-to-near-IR 13-band photometry for all 103\u000asources and provide redshift constraints for 75 sources without previously\u000aknown redshift. Out of those, eight have reliable photometric redshifts at\u000az&gt;1.3, while for the other 67 sources we provide upper limits. Six of the\u000aformer eight are BL Lac objects, which quadruples the sample of confirmed\u000ahigh-redshift BL Lac. This includes three sources with redshifts higher than\u000athe previous record for BL Lac, including CRATES J0402-2615 with the best-fit\u000asolution at z~1.9.\u000a</p>

V<p>Context: As more and more data are collected by cosmic ray experiments such\u000aas the Pierre Auger Observatory and Telescope Array (TA), the search for the\u000asources of the Ultra High Energy Cosmic Rays (UHECR) continues. Already we have\u000asome hints about the sources or type of sources involved and more work is\u000arequired to confirm any of this. Aims: We intend to predict the UHECR fluxes\u000aand the maximal energies of particles from two complete samples of nearby\u000aactive galaxies, selected at radio and far-infrared frequencies. Also, we\u000ainvestigate the magnetic scattering of the UHECR path in the intervening cosmic\u000aspace. Methods: We propose here a new method of searching for the sources of\u000athe UHECR in three steps, first we model the activity of the type of sources\u000aand get the flux of UHECR and a maximal energy for particle acceleration, then\u000awe model the interaction and angle deflection in the intergalactic space and\u000afinally we simulate the distribution of the cosmic rays events that can be\u000astatistically compared with future data of the cosmic rays observatories.\u000aResults: We analyzed two classes of sources, gamma ray bursts (GRBs) and Radio\u000aGalaxies (RGs). Ordering by the UHECR flux, few RGs are viable candidates, as\u000afor GRB many sources are viable candidates, requiring less scattering of the\u000aparticles along their path to Earth to interpret the presently observed sky\u000adistribution. Most of the flux from RGs comes from the Southern sky, and most\u000aof the flux of particles from GRB comes from the North, although the\u000adifferences are so small as to require large statistics to confirm this. The\u000aintergalactic and Galactic magnetic fields may help to distinguish the two\u000aextreme cases, also pure protons from heavy nuclei at the same energy. As a\u000aconsequence flat spectrum radio sources such as 3C279 should confirm the\u000aproduction of UHECR in this class of sources through energetic neutrinos.\u000a</p>
