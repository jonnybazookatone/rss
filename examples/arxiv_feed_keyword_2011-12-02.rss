V<p>The tidal disruption of a solar mass star around a supermassive black hole\u000ahas been extensively studied analytically and numerically. In these events the\u000astar develops into an elongated banana-shaped structure. After completing an\u000aeccentric orbit, the bound debris fall onto the black hole, forming an\u000aaccretion disk and emitting radiation. The same process may occur on planetary\u000ascales, if a minor body orbits too close to its star. In the Solar System,\u000acomets fall directly onto our Sun or onto planets. If the star is a compact\u000aobject, the minor body can become tidally disrupted.

V<p>Astrophysical fluids are generically turbulent and this must be taken into\u000aaccount for most transport processes. We discuss how the preexisting turbulence\u000amodifies magnetic reconnection and how magnetic reconnection affects the MHD\u000aturbulent cascade. We show the intrinsic interdependence and interrelation of\u000amagnetic turbulence and magnetic reconnection, in particular, that strong\u000amagnetic turbulence in 3D requires reconnection and 3D magnetic turbulence\u000aentails fast reconnection. We follow the approach in Eyink, Lazarian &amp; Vishniac\u000a2011 to show that the expressions of fast magnetic reconnection in Lazarian &amp;\u000aVishniac 1999 can be recovered if Richardson diffusion of turbulent flows is\u000aused instead of ordinary Ohmic diffusion. This does not revive, however, the\u000aconcept of magnetic turbulent diffusion which assumes that magnetic fields can\u000abe mixed up in a passive way down to a very small dissipation scales. On the\u000acontrary, we are dealing the reconnection of dynamically important magnetic\u000afield bundles which strongly resist bending and have well defined mean\u000adirection weakly perturbed by turbulence. We argue that in the presence of\u000aturbulence the very concept of flux-freezing requires modification. The\u000adiffusion that arises from magnetic turbulence can be called reconnection\u000adiffusion as it based on reconnection of magnetic field lines. The reconnection\u000adiffusion has important implications for the continuous transport processes in\u000amagnetized plasmas and for star formation. In addition, fast magnetic\u000areconnection in turbulent media induces the First order Fermi acceleration of\u000aenergetic particles, can explain solar flares and gamma ray bursts. However,\u000athe most dramatic consequence of these developments is the fact that the\u000astandard flux freezing concept must be radically modified in the presence of\u000aturbulence.\u000a</p>

A large fraction of the population detected by Fermi is formed by BL\u000aLacertae (BL Lac) objects, whose sample has always suffered from a severe\u000aredshift incompleteness due to the quasi-featureless optical spectra. Our goal\u000ais to provide a significant increase of the number of confirmed high-redshift\u000aBL Lac objects contained in the 2 LAC Fermi/LAT catalog. For 103 Fermi/LAT\u000ablazars, photometric redshifts using spectral energy distribution fitting have\u000abeen obtained. The photometry includes 13 broad-band filters from the far\u000aultraviolet to the near-IR observed with Swift/UVOT and the multi-channel\u000aimager GROND at the MPG/ESO 2.2m telescope. Data have been taken\u000aquasi-simultaneously and the remaining source-intrinsic variability has been\u000acorrected for. We release the UV-to-near-IR 13-band photometry for all 103\u000asources and provide redshift constraints for 75 sources without previously\u000aknown redshift.

V<p>In cosmic-ray physics, large field of view experiments are triggered by a\u000anumber of signals laying on different angular scales: point-like and extended\u000agamma-ray sources, diffuse emissions, as well as large and intermediate scale\u000acosmic-ray anisotropies. The separation of all these contributions is crucial,\u000amostly when they overlap with each other. Needlets are a form of spherical\u000awavelets that have recently drawn a lot of attention in the cosmological\u000aliterature, especially in connection with the analysis of CMB data. Needlets\u000aenjoy a number of important statistical and numerical properties which suggest\u000athat they can be very effective in handling cosmic-ray and gamma-ray data\u000aanalysis. An application of needlets to astroparticle physics is shown here. In\u000aparticular, light will be thrown on how useful they might be for estimating\u000abackground and foreground contributions.
