(arXiv:1109.4150v3 [astro-ph.CO] UPDATED)</b></h3></p>	<p><p>[abridged] While observations of Local Group galaxies show a very simple,
local star formation law in which the star formation rate per unit area in each
patch of a galaxy scales linearly with the molecular gas surface density,
recent observations of both Milky Way molecular clouds and high redshift
galaxies apparently show a more complicated relationship, in which regions of
equal surface density can form stars at quite different rates. These data have
been interpreted as implying either that different star formation laws apply in
different circumstances, that the star formation law is sensitive to
large-scale galaxy properties rather than local properties, or that there are
high density thresholds for star formation. Here we collate resolved
observations of Milky Way molecular clouds, kpc-scale observations of Local
Group galaxies, and unresolved observations of both disk and starburst galaxies
in the local universe and at high redshift. We show that all of these data are
in fact consistent with a simple, local, volumetric star formation law. The
apparent variations stem from the fact that the observed objects have a wide
variety of 3D size scales and degrees of internal clumping, so even at fixed
gas column density the regions being observed can have wildly varying volume
densities. We provide a simple theoretical framework to remove this projection
effect, and we show that all the data, from small Solar neighborhood clouds
with masses ~10^3 Msun to sub-mm galaxies with masses ~10^11 Msun, fall on a
single star formation law in which the SFR is simply ~1% of the molecular gas
mass per local free-fall time. In contrast, proposed star formation laws in
which the star formation timescale is set by the galactic rotation period or
the SFR is linearly proportional to the gas mass above some density threshold
fail to match at least some of the data.

</p>	<p><h3><b>Stellar Populations of Highly Magnified Lensed Galaxies: Young Starbursts at z~2. (arXiv:1110.2833v2 [astro-ph.CO] UPDATED)</b></h3></p>	<p><p>We present a comprehensive analysis of the rest-frame UV to near-IR spectral
energy distributions and rest-frame optical spectra of four of the brightest
gravitationally lensed galaxies in the literature: RCSGA 032727-132609 at
z=1.70, MS1512-cB58 at z=2.73, SGAS J152745.1+065219 at z=2.76 and SGAS
J122651.3+215220 at z=2.92. This includes new Spitzer imaging for RCSGA0327 as
well as new spectra, near-IR imaging and Spitzer imaging for SGAS1527 and
SGAS1226. Lensing magnifications of 3-4 magnitudes allow a detailed study of
the stellar populations and physical conditions. We compare star formation
rates as measured from the SED fit, the H-alpha and [OII] emission lines, and
the UV+IR bolometric luminosity where 24 micron photometry is available. The
SFR estimate from the SED fit is consistently higher than the other indicators,
which suggests that the Calzetti dust extinction law used in the SED fitting is
too flat for young star-forming galaxies at z~2. Our analysis finds similar
stellar population parameters for all four lensed galaxies: stellar masses
3-7*10^9 M_sun, young ages ~ 100 Myr, little dust content E(B-V)=0.10-0.25, and
star formation rates around 20-100 M_sun/yr. Compared to typical values for the
galaxy population at z~2, this suggests we are looking at newly formed,
starbursting systems that have only recently started the build-up of stellar
mass. These results constitute the first detailed, uniform analysis of a sample
of the growing number of strongly lensed galaxies known at z~2.

</p>	<p><h3><b>The metallicity properties of zCOSMOS galaxies at 0.2<z<0.8. (arXiv:1110.4408v2 [astro-ph.CO] UPDATED)</b></h3></p>	<p><p>We study the metallicity properties of galaxies in the zCOSMOS sample between
0.2&lt;z&lt;0.8. At z&lt;0.46, where Ha and [NII] are detected, we find the same
dependence of metallicity on stellar mass and Star Formation Rate (SFR), the
Fundamental Metallicity Relation, found by Mannucci et al. (2010) in SDSS
galaxies on a similar redshift range. We extend this relation to higher
redshift, 0.49&lt;z&lt;0.8 where the R23 metallicity index can be measured in our
data, finding no evidence for evolution, and a metallicity scatter around the
relation of about 0.16 dex. This result confirms, with a much higher level of
significance with respect to previous works, the absence of evolution of the
FMR during the last half of cosmic history.
