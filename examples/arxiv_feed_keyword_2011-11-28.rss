Both cosmic ray experiments are located inside the South\u000aAtlantic Anomaly (SAA) region. Our analysis of several examples shows\u000asimilarities in the behavior of the counting rate of low energy (above 100 MeV)\u000aparticles in association with the solar activity (solar flares and\u000ainterplanetary shocks). We also report an observation by the Tupi experiment of\u000athe enhancement of muons at ground level with a significance higher than 8\u000asigma in the 1-sec binning counting rate (raw data) in close time coincidence\u000a(T-184 sec) with the Swift-BAT GRB110928B (trigger=504307). The GRB 110928B\u000acoordinates are in the field of view of the vertical Tupi telescope, and the\u000aburst was close to the MAXI source J1836-194. The 5-min muon counting rate in\u000athe vertical Tupi telescope as well as publicly available data from Auger (15\u000aminutes averages of the scaler rates) show small peaks above the background\u000afluctuations at the time following the Swift-BAT GRB 110928B trigger.

V<p>Dwarf galaxies are widely believed to be among the best targets for indirect\u000adark matter searches using high-energy gamma rays; and indeed gamma-ray\u000aemission from these objects has long been a subject of detailed study for\u000aground-based atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes. Here, we update current\u000aexclusion limits obtained on the closest dwarf, the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy,\u000ain light of recent realistic dark matter halo models. The constraints on the\u000avelocity-weighted annihilation cross section of the dark matter particle are of\u000aa few 10$^{-23}$ cm$^{3}$s$^{-1}$ in the TeV energy range for a 50 h exposure.\u000aThe limits are extrapolated to the sensitivities of future Cherenkov Telescope\u000aArrays. For 200 h of observation time, the sensitivity at 95% C.L. reaches\u000a10$^{-25}$ cm$^{3}$s$^{-1}$. Possible astrophysical backgrounds from gamma-ray\u000asources dissembled in Sagittarius dwarf are studied. It is shown that with\u000along-enough observation times, gamma-ray background from millisecond pulsars in\u000aa globular cluster contained within Sagittarius dwarf may limit the sensitivity\u000ato dark matter annihilations.\u000a</p>

V<p>Dwarf galaxies are widely believed to be among the best targets for indirect\u000adark matter searches using high-energy gamma rays; and indeed gamma-ray\u000aemission from these objects has long been a subject of detailed study for\u000aground-based atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes. Here, we update current\u000aexclusion limits obtained on the closest dwarf, the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy,\u000ain light of recent realistic dark matter halo models. The constraints on the\u000avelocity-weighted annihilation cross section of the dark matter particle are of\u000aa few 10$^{-23}$ cm$^{3}$s$^{-1}$ in the TeV energy range for a 50 h exposure.\u000aThe limits are extrapolated to the sensitivities of future Cherenkov Telescope\u000aArrays. For 200 h of observation time, the sensitivity at 95% C.L. reaches\u000a10$^{-25}$ cm$^{3}$s$^{-1}$. Possible astrophysical backgrounds from gamma-ray\u000asources dissembled in Sagittarius dwarf are studied. It is shown that with\u000along-enough observation times, gamma-ray background from millisecond pulsars in\u000aa globular cluster contained within Sagittarius dwarf may limit the sensitivity\u000ato dark matter annihilations.\u000a</p>

V<p>Galaxy clusters are being assembled today in the most energetic phase of\u000ahierarchical structure formation which manifests itself in powerful shocks that\u000acontribute to a substantial energy density of cosmic rays (CRs). Hence,\u000aclusters are expected to be luminous gamma-ray emitters since they also act as\u000aenergy reservoirs for additional CR sources, such as active galactic nuclei and\u000asupernova-driven galactic winds. To detect the gamma-ray emission from CR\u000ainteractions with the ambient cluster gas, we conducted the deepest to date\u000aobservational campaign targeting a galaxy cluster at very high-energy\u000agamma-rays and observed the Perseus cluster with the MAGIC Cherenkov telescopes\u000afor a total of ~85 hr of effective observing time. This campaign resulted in\u000athe detection of the central radio galaxy NGC 1275 at energies E &gt; 100 GeV with\u000aa very steep energy spectrum. Here, we restrict our analysis to energies E &gt;\u000a630 GeV and detect no significant gamma-ray excess. This constrains the average\u000aCR-to-thermal pressure ratio to be &lt;= 1-2%, depending on assumptions and the\u000amodel for CR emission. Comparing these gamma-ray upper limits to predictions\u000afrom cosmological cluster simulations that include CRs constrains the maximum\u000aCR acceleration efficiency at structure formation shocks to be &lt; 50%.\u000aAlternatively, this may argue for non-negligible CR transport processes such as\u000aCR streaming and diffusion into the outer cluster regions. Finally, we derive\u000alower limits on the magnetic field distribution assuming that the Perseus radio\u000amini-halo is generated by secondary electrons/positrons that are created in\u000ahadronic CR interactions: assuming a spectrum of E^-2.2 around TeV energies as\u000aimplied by cluster simulations, we limit the central magnetic field to be &gt; 4-9\u000amicroG, depending on the rate of decline of the magnetic field strength toward\u000alarger radii.\u000a</p>
